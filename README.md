# F20GA

We had a meeting once groups were assigned to decide on a possible theme, it came to either modeling our ducks we were given at the start of the course, or fastfood. After further discussion, we decided on fast food. From there we each picked a fastfood item. Typically, all this food wouldn't be served at the same fastfood resturant but we had to pick stuff that would challenge us.

Thus we went with:

Pizza
Fries
Hotdog
Shake
Burger
