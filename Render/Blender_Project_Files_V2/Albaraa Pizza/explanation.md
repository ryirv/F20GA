# Pizza Base Process
## Attempt 1
I have a lot of experience with autodesk, so learning the differences of Blender has been quite the ride. In attempt 1, i modelled a cylinder and cut out an inner hole trying create a think crust. Afterwards I tried a lot at adding a natural fillet between the crust and the base but it still looked quite blocky for a pizza.  I also added a cheese cylinder which looked terrible this can be seen in "cheesy.blend"

## Attempt 2
I liked the sculpting way of blender so thought I could take a clay ball and model it into the shape of a pizza, but that very obviously failed. This can be seen in "scultipedbase.blend"

## Attempt 3
I attempted the first method again but tried to sculpt over the base but that didn't work at all, i added textures but it still turned out quite bad. This can be seem with an attempted flattening using sculpting in pizzabase.blend.


#Pepperoni
I attempted to make pepperoni, one which was just a flat oval and another which was a oval with holes in it, these can be seen in both pepperoni files.
#Onions
I created a sphere then cut out another sphere to make it look like a slice of onion, i then duplicated the shape and combined them using a boolean modifier.
