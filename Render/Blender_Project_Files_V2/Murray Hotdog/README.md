# Basic Sculpt of Model

## Bun

The bun has been massively smoothed out in this version and flattened at the bottom.
there is still issues present with some verticies being sharp in some areas.
Crease effect used to make the model look a bit more accurate.

## Hotdog

The hotdogs has been modeled, created using an extremely elongated sphere and added inperfections via creasing and bulge.

## Ketchup

Ketchup was created using an almost completely flat extremely elongated sphere that was warped to give of the wavey effect shown in the sketch, while making sure it keep within contact of the hotdog and does not float.
