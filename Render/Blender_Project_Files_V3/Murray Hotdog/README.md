# Smoothing and painting

## Bun

The Sharp edges of the bun have been remodeled and flattened out and the bun has been painted, to show the light flour on the top of the bun and darker bread at the base.

## Hotdog

The hotdogs model has been slightly tweaked to make it smoother and painted with a dark brown colour, symbifying a deep grilled hotdog.

## Ketchup

Ketchup has also had a smooth pass but using the vertex simplification rather than the smooth sculpt tool, to remove sharp edged where the vertex's overlapped, painted a vibrant red, similar colour to match the condiment.
