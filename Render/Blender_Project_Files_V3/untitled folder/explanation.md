# Pizza Base

## Final Base
I learned about dynotop, I took attempt 1 and used the sculpting methods to texture it all, making it look much much better and dough like, i then added a dough image texture. This can be seen in "epicpizzabase1.blend"

#Toppings
I created a lattice like structure for cheese, and a cylinder for sauce. I tried to sculpt the sauce but it ended up terrible this can be seen in "rubbishsauce.blend".

I attempted the lattice for the cheese with circular holes.  But it looked terrible, this can be seen in "holeycheese.blend"
I then tried it again but with diagonal lines but again it didn't look good, this can be seen in "latticecheeseweird.blend"

Since the cheese lattice didn't work out at all, so I left the cheese and instead used an image which had melted cheese and sauce which looked much better, this will be seen in the final section.
