# Initial concept and design of Hotdog

## Sketch

The idea i had when creating the sketch was to make a design similar to very rough concept art.
Where there would be a view for the major sides of the object.
This would be used later to help me create the hotdog.
Although I later decided that some of the proportions needed tweaking, namely where the hotdog would be located with respect to the bun.

## Primative Bun Model

There is also the primative model created from scaling stretching the stock sphere until it followed something somewhat resembling a hotdog bun's general shape, before extruding the top verticies to make room for where the hotdog would go.
I then had to remove and correct the verticies that were on the edges as they had gone through the bottom. Making sure there are no holes within the model.
