# Final Pizza

I added pepperoni by creating an oval shape then using the array method to repeat it then rotated the array around a benzier circle. I used the sculpting methods to texture it.

I applied a basic dough texture to the pizza base and then used the texture paint feature to make sure it appeared in the right places. I then used a sauce and cheese image to cover the splat shape I created and finally added pepperoni image texture to the pepperoni. This can be seen in "finalpizza.blend"

I then added the onions in random places.


# Onions
The onions took quite a bit of work, i couldn't use the dynotop methods for this as it looked very wrong, so i just fiddled with the roughness and glossy levels following the linkedin tutorial, i then fiddled around with the texture nodes. For the colouring, i unwrapped the shape then wrapped around the colour cube thing to see where I was painting, i then took the whiteish colour from an onion image and painted the inner sides of the onions, i then took a purpley colour from another onion image and painted the outside of the slices.

For the colouring, at first i just wrapped the whole onion in an onion image but it didn't look great. An image of this can be seen in onionwrap.png

I then used a pinky colour from an image but it came out too pink and radioactive looking, this can be seen in pinonion.png. I then changed the shade and that is what was included on the final pizza.

# Pizza Box
I made a simple pizza box and added a cardboard image as the texture with the logo that Dean created.

# Table
I made a simple table with a wooden top and metallic legs, both were textured with images.
