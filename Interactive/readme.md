# Week 10
We had a meeting discussing ways to do the interactive scene. Originally we wanted to do a fancy vending machine which cooks the food but we quickly realised how difficult this would be in this frame of time. Instead Dean came up with the idea of
cleaning up a crime scene left after the food fight from the last submission. We all loved the idea.
On the Friday we had a meeting for 6 hours just trying to get the code to run on our machines, we only had it running on 1. Afterwards Albaraa and Teo got help from Emmanuel, who got it working on Teo's machine and we came to the conclusion it would not work 
on Albaraa's macbook. Teo then gave instructions for the rest of the team to follow and we were a go!

# Week 11
On Monday the team were chatting for 6/7 hours again. Albaraa focussed on trying to hack the object loader to support multiple objects (failed). Teo got movement working with the arrow keys and Murray got the mouse rotations to work. Dean worked on allowing us to select
a particular object in a scene. Later than night Ryan, Murray and Teo worked on getting the texturing to work (which succeeded woo!), they had to UV map all the textures individually.
On Tuesday, Teo created the code to select the object in front of a person (lots of maths), Albaraa got pop ups working and reading from txt files, while Murray and Ryan finished of texturing and exporting each individual object and scene.
On Wednesday, Albaraa got pop ups working on all the objects while Teo added functionality for selected objects to move with the camera. Dean worked on lighting, Murray worked on textures and Ryan worked on placing the objects correctly in the scene.
