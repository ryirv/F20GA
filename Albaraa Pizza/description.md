# Pizza Base Process
## Attempt 1
I have a lot of experience with autodesk, so learning the differences of Blender has been quite the ride. In attempt 1, i modelled a cylinder and cut out an inner hole trying create a think crust. Afterwards I tried a lot at adding a natural fillet between the crust and the base but it still looked quite blocky for a pizza.

## Attempt 2
I liked the sculpting way of blender so thought I could take a clay ball and model it into the shape of a pizza, but that very obviously failed.

## Attempt 3
I attempted the first method again but tried to sculpt over the base but that didn't work at all, i added textures but it still turned out quite bad.

## Attempt 4 dynotop
I learned about dynotop, I took attempt 1 and used the sculpting methods to texture it all, making it look much much better.

# Toppings Process
## Attempt 1
I created a lattice like structure for cheese, and a cylinder for sauce. I then created another cylinder shape for pepperoni.

## Attempt 2
I attempted the lattice again but with circles instead. I then used dynotop on the sauce to make it more realistic as well.

## Attempt 3
The cheese lattice didn't work out at all, so I left the cheese. 

## Final Attempt
Instead of modelling the cheese and sauce seperately, i decided to just use the one item to mimic both, i'll explain more later. The pepperoni I crafted from a cylinder again and then textured it accordingly. I applied an array to create more than one slice of pepperoni, I then created a circle and got the pepperoni to follow around it.

# Materials and Colouring
I applied a basic dough texture to the pizza base and then used the texture paint feature to make sure it appeared in the right places. I then used a sauce and cheese image to cover the splat shape I created and finally added pepperoni image texture to the pepperoni.
