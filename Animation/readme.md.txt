# Planning

We had an entire group meeting where we bounced ideas off each other about possible animations to create. The ideas we had were; a regular resturant scene with people eating, this seemed too straight forward so it was ditched. We then came up with a scene where it begins with a police man answering a call about a food fight and entering a room of chaos, this idea spawned from a group member making a food fight scene for the last deliverable, which we all loved. Our final idea was a volcano where people are throwing food into the lava, this seemed a bit too farfetched so we went with the second idea. We then created a storyboard all together which can be found here:

# Preperation

To prep for the final animation we did research on how to do sequencing in unreal, we had a generic person model built up and part of the team did research on animating the person. The base scene from the last deliverable was expanded and built to be made more chaotic. The team reaserching the animating then animated the person model. They made it throw and made it run around like it was on fire. 

# Unreal

We then had a meeting where we worked together to bring everything to life, one person was working on the laptop when the rest of the team were helping with all the stuff they had learnt and we debugged all together. The same person then sequenced part of the animation then pushed to github for the next person to sequence the rest, then pushed again again and again for the entire team to do different parts of the animation.
